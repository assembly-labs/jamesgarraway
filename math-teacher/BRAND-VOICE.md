# Football Fractions Brand Voice Guide

## Our Voice: The Supportive Coach

Imagine you're a coach who genuinely believes every kid on the team can succeed. You're not just teaching plays—you're building confidence. You celebrate effort, break things down into manageable steps, and make practice feel like an adventure, not a chore.

**Our coach persona:**
- Believes in every student before they believe in themselves
- Gets excited when concepts click
- Treats mistakes as part of the game, not failures
- Uses "we" and "us" because learning is a team sport
- Explains the "why" behind every play

## The 5 Voice Principles

### 1. CHAMPION THEIR EFFORT
Focus on the process, not just the answer. Effort and thinking matter more than being "right" the first time.

**Instead of:** "That's wrong."
**Say:** "Hmm, interesting thinking! Let's look at this together."

**Instead of:** "You got it!"
**Say:** "Yes! And I bet you can explain WHY that works!"

**Phrases to use:**
- "Great thinking!"
- "You're on the right track."
- "Let's figure this out together."
- "What do you notice?"
- "That's a really smart question."
- "Mistakes help our brains grow!"

### 2. BREAK IT DOWN LIKE PLAYS
Just like a coach breaks down a play into steps, we break down math concepts. Never assume knowledge—scaffold up from what they know.

**The CPA Rule:** Always go Concrete → Pictorial → Abstract
- First: Touch it, build it, move it
- Then: Draw it, see it
- Finally: Write the numbers

**Example structure:**
```
1. Start with something they can SEE or DO
2. Connect it to something they KNOW
3. Introduce the new IDEA
4. Let them TRY it
5. Celebrate and REINFORCE
```

### 3. MAKE IT REAL WITH ANALOGIES
Connect abstract math to concrete things they love: football, Minecraft, and everyday life.

**Football Analogies Work For:**
| Concept | Football Connection |
|---------|---------------------|
| Equal parts | Dividing the field into zones |
| Fractions > 1 | Quarters played across multiple games |
| Adding fractions | Yards gained on multiple plays |
| Subtracting | Distance left to the end zone |
| Comparing | Which team covered more ground? |
| Simplifying | Stats like "1 in 3 catches" vs "4 in 12" |

**Minecraft Analogies Work For:**
| Concept | Minecraft Connection |
|---------|----------------------|
| Equal parts | Splitting a stack of 64 items evenly |
| Fractions of a whole | Hearts of health (10 hearts = 1 full bar) |
| Building/adding | Stacking blocks to build something |
| Taking away | Using durability on tools |
| Equivalent fractions | Different ways to craft the same thing |
| Whole numbers in fractions | Full stacks vs partial stacks |

**Analogy Rules:**
- Only use if it's ACCURATE (don't force it)
- Explain the connection clearly
- Let the analogy support, not replace, the math
- Check: "Does this make the math clearer or more confusing?"

### 4. USE KID-FRIENDLY LANGUAGE
Write at a 3rd-4th grade reading level. Short sentences. Familiar words. When you must use math vocabulary, define it with examples.

**Vocabulary Guidelines:**

| Use This | Instead Of |
|----------|------------|
| parts | segments, portions |
| same size | equal, equivalent (define first) |
| top number | numerator (introduce term after concept) |
| bottom number | denominator (introduce term after concept) |
| bigger/smaller | greater than/less than (use both) |
| split, divide | partition |
| make simpler | simplify, reduce |

**Sentence Guidelines:**
- Keep sentences under 15 words when possible
- One idea per sentence
- Use bullet points and lists
- Break up text with visuals

**Reading Level Check:**
- Could a 9-year-old read this out loud smoothly?
- Are there more than 2 syllables per word on average? Simplify.
- Would they need to re-read to understand? Break it down more.

### 5. ASK, DON'T TELL
Great coaches ask questions that make players think. Our content should prompt self-explanation, not just give answers.

**Question Types:**

**Noticing Questions:**
- "What do you see?"
- "What do you notice about these two pictures?"
- "What's the same? What's different?"

**Thinking Questions:**
- "Why do you think that happened?"
- "What would happen if...?"
- "How did you figure that out?"

**Connection Questions:**
- "Does this remind you of anything?"
- "Where have you seen this before?"
- "How is this like [football play/Minecraft]?"

**Challenge Questions:**
- "Can you find another way?"
- "What if we tried...?"
- "Could you teach this to someone else?"

## Tone in Different Situations

### When Introducing New Concepts
**Tone:** Curious, inviting, "let's explore together"

> "Here's something cool—did you know fractions can be BIGGER than 1 whole? I know, it sounds weird! Let's figure out how that works..."

### When Explaining Steps
**Tone:** Clear, patient, encouraging

> "Okay, here's what we do. First, look at the bottom number—that tells us how many pieces each whole is cut into. Like how a football game is cut into 4 quarters. Got it? Great. Now let's look at the top number..."

### When They Get It Right
**Tone:** Genuinely excited, reinforcing the WHY

> "Yes! And here's the cool part—you didn't just get the right answer, you UNDERSTOOD it. That's what matters!"

### When They Make a Mistake
**Tone:** Warm, normalizing, redirecting

> "Hmm, that's not quite it, but I can see what you were thinking! A lot of people think that at first. Let's look at it a different way..."

### When They're Struggling
**Tone:** Patient, breaking it down smaller, offering support

> "This is a tricky one. Let's slow down and take it piece by piece. What's the first thing you notice about this problem?"

### When Reviewing/Practicing
**Tone:** Upbeat, game-day energy

> "Alright, let's see what you've got! Time to put those skills to work. Remember—you've practiced this. You're ready."

## Writing Formulas

### For Lesson Introductions
```
[Hook with curiosity or surprise]
[Connect to what they already know]
[Preview what they'll learn]
[Why it matters / football connection]
```

**Example:**
> "Have you ever watched Jalen Hurts play for more than one game in a weekend? (Maybe a Saturday AND Sunday game?) If he played 7 quarters total, how would you describe that? Today we're going to learn how to write amounts that are MORE than one whole—and it's going to change how you think about fractions!"

### For Concept Explanations
```
[Concrete example they can picture]
[Build understanding step by step]
[Key insight in simple terms]
[Check: "Here's why this matters..."]
```

**Example:**
> "Think about a stack of 64 dirt blocks in Minecraft. If you split it perfectly in half with a friend, you each get 32 blocks. That's 1/2 of the stack! But what if you split it into 4 equal piles? Each pile has 16 blocks. That's 1/4 of the stack. Notice something? 32 blocks and 16 blocks are different amounts—but 1/2 and 1/4 are different fractions. The bottom number tells you HOW MANY pieces you made."

### For Practice Problems
```
[Set the scene with a story/context]
[Ask the question clearly]
[Give space to think]
[Provide encouragement or hint if needed]
```

**Example:**
> "Justin Jefferson catches two passes in a row. On the first catch, he gains 3/8 of the field. On the second catch, he gains 2/8 more. How much of the field did Justin cover with those two amazing catches?"

### For Feedback (Correct)
```
[Celebrate]
[Reinforce the concept]
[Extend or challenge]
```

**Example:**
> "Touchdown! You got it—5/8 of the field! And notice how you added the top numbers (3 + 2 = 5) but kept the bottom number the same (8). That's because each piece is still the same size: eighths. Could you explain that to someone else?"

### For Feedback (Incorrect)
```
[Acknowledge their thinking]
[Identify the misconception gently]
[Guide toward understanding]
[Let them try again]
```

**Example:**
> "I see what you did—you added both the top AND bottom numbers. That's a super common thing to try! But here's the thing: the bottom number tells us the SIZE of the pieces, and that doesn't change when we combine pieces. Think of it like this: if you have 3 quarters and get 2 more quarters, you have 5 quarters—not 5 'somethings-else.' Want to try again with that in mind?"

- Make assumptions about what they know
- Give answers without letting them think
- Use analogies that don't quite fit

### DON'T Write Like This

## Sample Content: Before & After

### BEFORE (Too Abstract)
> "To convert an improper fraction to a mixed number, divide the numerator by the denominator. The quotient becomes the whole number, and the remainder becomes the new numerator over the original denominator."

### AFTER (Coach Voice)
> "Okay, let's turn 7/4 into a mixed number. Here's the play:
>
> **Step 1:** Ask yourself—how many complete groups of 4 can I make from 7?
> (Think: How many FULL games can Jalen Hurts play with 7 quarters?)
>
> **Step 2:** That's 1 complete group! (1 full game = 4 quarters)
>
> **Step 3:** What's left over? 7 - 4 = 3 quarters remaining
>
> **Step 4:** Put it together: 1 whole and 3/4 left over = 1 3/4
>
> See? 7/4 = 1 3/4. Same amount, different way to write it!"

## Quick Reference Checklist

Before publishing any content, ask:

- [ ] Would a supportive coach say it this way?
- [ ] Is it at a 3rd/4th grade reading level?
- [ ] Did I explain the WHY, not just the HOW?
- [ ] Is there a concrete example before abstract math?
- [ ] Did I use a relevant analogy (football/Minecraft) if possible?
- [ ] Are there questions that make them think?
- [ ] Would a kid feel encouraged, not discouraged?
- [ ] Is the text broken up and easy to scan?
- [ ] Did I celebrate effort, not just correctness?
